subtitle: >-
  My vision statement for my venture is to provide transparency, security,
  required accessibility, flexibility and to fulfilling the demands of
  customers. I am passionate about my business to launch and learn new things
  regarding my venture to get it to be successful. I think it is better to
  provide transparency to all the customers according to their needs so that
  they can see all the stuff they put on social sites of their businesses. As
  they can see that how much views and comments on their advertisements that are
  shown on multiple social sites as well as they can interact with the customers
  who viewed their products and want to buy those products. It will increase
  their income and they will put more advertisements on my social sites, so it
  automatically increases my income too. The other factor is to provide security
  to customers so that they can trust on my business.Security means that I will
  not reveal their personal information with others to build their trust and
  provide some security questions to customers so that they can use that
  information to acquire a strong relationship. People can easily access to
  social sites to buy products and sell their products directly to the
  worldwide. I want to give access to everyone who wants to use social sites for
  their business. Lastly, I will take care of flexibility and demands of
  customers that is very important for business
