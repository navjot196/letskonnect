title: Vision
subtitle: "My vision statement for my venture is to provide transparency, security, required accessibility,\r\n\nflexibility and to fulfilling the demands of customers.\r\n\nI am passionate about my business to launch and learn new things regarding my venture to get it\r\n\nto be successful. I think it is better to provide transparency to all the customers according to their\r\n\nneeds so that they can see all the stuff they put on social sites of their businesses. As they can see\r\n\nthat how much views and comments on their advertisements that are shown on multiple social\r\n\nsites as well as they can interact with the customers who viewed their products and want to buy\r\n\nthose products. It will increase their income and they will put more advertisements on my social\r\n\nsites, so it automatically increases my income too.\r\n\nThe other factor is to provide security to customers so that they can trust on my business.\r\n\nSecurity means that I will not reveal their personal information with others to build their trust\r\n\nand provide some security questions to customers so that they can use that information to acquire\r\n\na strong relationship. People can easily access to social sites to buy products and sell their\r\n\nproducts directly to the worldwide. I want to give access to everyone who wants to use social\r\n\nsites for their business. Lastly, I will take care of flexibility and demands of customers that is\r\n\nvery important for business"
