If we do not use latest features and technology in our products, then\r\n\nit leads to our venture towards loss.\r\n\n**Market Risk**:\r\n\nIt can be also a big risk in social media website venture because there are lot of websites\r\n\navailable in the market and all have different features and different technology. Similar\r\n\nwebsites can be strong competition for our business in market and it can reduce our customers.\r\n\n**Financial Risk:**\r\n\nWhen we start a new business, we all need money and we must do investment in venture. If\r\n\nour venture would not perform well in market, then we will lose our all money and reputation\r\n\nin market and we will become unable to pay back to stakeholders and banks who are invested\r\n\non our business.\r\n\n**Team Risk:**\n\nTeam is a most important factor in a business because without a cooperative team we cannot\r\n\ndo anything and cannot achieve our market goal. Supporting team members are pillars to start\r\n\na new venture. If we do not have supportive team, then it could be dangerous for our business.\r\n\n**Government Risk:**\r\n\nBefore starting a business, we need to get permission from the higher authority. If they approve,\r\n\nonly then we can go further with our business so if government does not give permission\r\n\nregarding the business then we cannot launch our products in market."
