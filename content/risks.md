  **Technology Risk**


  In these days, technology develops on regular basis so if we do not go with
  latest flow then it


  will create a big problem for my venture because technology changes day by day
  and all people


  want to use new features. If we do not use latest features and technology in
  our products, then


  it leads to our venture towards loss.

  website venture because there are lot of websitesavailable in the market and
  all have different features and different technology. Similarwebsites can be
  strong competition for our business in market and it can reduce our
  customers.")


  **Financial Risk:**


  When we start a new business, we all need money and we must do investment in
  venture. If


  our venture would not perform well in market, then we will lose our all money
  and reputation


  in market and we will become unable to pay back to stakeholders and banks who
  are invested


  on our business.


  **Team Risk:**


  Team is a most important factor in a business because without a cooperative
  team we cannot


  do anything and cannot achieve our market goal. Supporting team members are
  pillars to start


  a new venture. If we do not have supportive team, then it could be dangerous
  for our business.


  **Government Risk:**


  Before starting a business, we need to get permission from the higher
  authority. If they approve,


  only then we can go further with our business so if government does not give
  permission


  regarding the business then we cannot launch our products in market.
